# Frontend Mentor - Profile Card Component Solution

This is my solution for the [Profile Card Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ). These challenges help me enhance my Front-End development skills by building projects that mimic real-world design scenarios.

## Overview

### The Challenge

The task was to create a responsive profile card based on the given design. The card should include user details, statistics, and background patterns, all styled to match the provided mockups. The primary objectives were:

- Implement a visually appealing profile card component.
- Ensure the layout and design are responsive across various screen sizes.
- Use semantic HTML and clean CSS.

### What I Learned

This project helped me practice:

- **Using Flexbox** for layout structure and alignment.
- **CSS Variables** to maintain a consistent color theme across the project.
- Implementing fixed positioning and transformations for background elements (e.g., patterns).
- Enhancing card designs with borders, spacing, and hover effects.

Some specific CSS techniques I applied:

- Using `border-box` for consistent sizing across elements.
- Creating responsive layouts with fixed and relative units (`px` and `%`).
- Styling with custom fonts from Google Fonts.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Experiment with **CSS Grid** to enhance my layout skills.
- Implement more advanced **accessibility features** using ARIA roles and attributes.
- Add animation effects to make components more interactive.
